    “He said I need to do it this way.” said Yuvaraj with exasperation.

    “Really? But why?” asked the commander inquisitively.

    “Because of the rule.”

    “Well where is that written?” Asked the commander observing the hint of despair in Yuvaraj’s response.

    “In the book of rules.” 

    “The book of rules hasn’t been revised since the last author died.”

    “What do you mean?” Yuvaraj asked optimistically.

    “It means f**k that rule. You need to write your own rules by trying this thing your way.” Commander concluded bolstering Yuvaraj’s hope.

-- The End.
