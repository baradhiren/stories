    "Once upon a time there was a man named कली. He came from a कुल of people very different from him." said रणधीर.

    "He knew he was different because he could not find any similarities. Wherever he went, He saw differences."

    "Then what happened रणधीर?"

    "Well, What happens to a person who always looks at differences? They need more."

    "More?"

    "More."

    "More, What?"

    "More Everything."

    "But I had heard we had limited resources."

    "Yes. That is why he gave birth to कल्कि."

    "But he killed him."

    "Because that is what he wanted all along."

-- The End.
