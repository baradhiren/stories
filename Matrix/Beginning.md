    "How is this any different?"

    "Not everything has to have clear boundaries to be different. But here it is."
    
    "A boundary to a new beginning." a third voice added to the conversation.
    
    "Few will know about this. And Fewer will act on it. But this should be marked as the beginning of a new dawn."

    "But how is it going to be any different?" asked the first voice.

    "It has a history."

-- The End.
