    "विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद याति पात्रताम्।
    पात्रत्वात् धनम् आप्नोति धनाद धर्मं ततः सुखम् ||" said the Guru.

    "Guruji, Please also help me understand its meaning." replied the सरपंच.

    "Certainly! Knowledge bestows humility, and through humility, one gains worthiness.
    With worthiness, wealth is acquired, and through wealth, righteous living is achieved, leading to happiness."

This marked another day for the training.

-- The End.
