    "So... You were going to share some updates."

    "Yes. Yes."

Updates:
    After 2 years of secondary, 2 years of higher secondary, 4 years of college, and 7 years of work I have observed that I have travelled too many environments. What do I mean by an environment?

    Well, Before the world got constricted to these two dimensional text system it was a beautiful, three dimensional space.

    You did not just utter words, But also heard tones, smelled things, looked at beauty, and tasted amazing delicacies. But most of all you got to admire it. Every single second of it. Physically, Mentally, Everyally. I guess that is why it was called reality. (:pun)

    But as we migrated to this Mirror of our society(in 2001), We left few bits behind. Behind would be an injustice to the experience. It creates a rift. Parts of which stay behind while the other move forward latching onto a false sense of reality. As a Quality assurance engineer, I have understood that "પહેલું સુખ તે જાતે નર્યા". Don't know what it means? Well then you need to try it out.

    Take a 6 month vacation from this 2 dimensional reality. Explore the outside of this Matrix.

    Talk to real people. Listen to them. "Attentively.md".
    Because after changing all these physical and virtual environments one thing that you discover is that you lose sense of your actual reality. It becomes difficult to talk to people. Like they don't understand you. Which pushes you further away into this small screen which keeps telling you what you need to do next.

    Leave. Enjoy the real reality till you find time to mess with this box.

    I have tried it. And I think I have been able to understand my father after such a long time. I now understand what my Mother who never went to School and always stayed in the Kitchen feels every single day. Being detached (not to be confused with unattached) from people of her own home.

    So, What did I do in the last 6 months?
    - Returned my rented bike after covering 1000KM across ગુજરાત.
    - Did a परिक्रमा of my તાલુકા where my ઘર is. (47KM by walk in a day.)
    - Trekked to the Everest base camp.
    - Got depressed because I was detached from my "Career" and not unattached.
    - Read Linguistics, AI, Fiction, History. Watched some classic movies.
    - Made an indie doggo friend for "Oscar.md".
    - Wrote a Demo of this two dimensional world.
    - Made some fertiliser for a local ગૌશાળા.
    - And now on my way to redefine Education.

    So, Is this Goodbye?
    Not actually. But I will be a different person when we meet next time. Because we will be sealing that rift again.
    It brings some difficult conversations to deal with. But every single one of those difficult conversations creates a knot of something new for our race.

    It's such a beautiful world. And I hope many of you get to experience it.

    Come to India some day if you get time. If destiny would have it. Our paths will definitely collide.

    Cheers to Life!

FAQs:
    "Wait? Is this a sad story? Why are you asking us to leave the Matrix."
    I am not telling you to leave it. I am asking you to have a healthy relationship with it. So that you can enjoy best of both worlds. 

    "But how can I do that? I think I am already enjoying the world as it is."
    Then this update does not have any meaning for you. You lucky ____ of a ____. (I also read metaphors btw. So, take this with a hint of mystery.)

    "What do you mean Goodbye?"
    I won't be available on any of the existing Social media platforms. If you would like to meet me come to ગુજરાત.
    Give me a chance to host you as a real human being.
