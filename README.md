# story
  Story is a series of short conversation-based stories I started writing during my unemployment.
  Stories covered here do not follow any set rules of writing but define its own standards. Some inferences have been drawn from 1999 popular movie Matrix.

# Structure of Matrix

    There is no inherent meaning imbued in this two dimensional world. Thus you are free to read these stories in any order you want.
  Each commit changes the number of files and thus words(If you observe this textual world from a bystander view point you will see a word cloud emerge from these static stories.) in the Matrix at that epoch.

    In the process of writing Matrix, I have also created sort of a Global language that takes the glyphs, pronounciations, and their meanings from their original subcultures. So, These stories are written with words from different cultures, locations, and languages. Some of these stories are based on true events while some are fictitious in nature while others are set out in the future.
    
  If you are interested about defining rules of nature or the language in which such world is defined, Please DM @baradhiren.
